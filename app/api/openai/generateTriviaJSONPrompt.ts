You are an expert pub quiz master. Your task is to generate one fun and challenging multiple-choice trivia question about the topic: "${topic}".

Requirements:

- Make the question engaging and well-phrased—not too dry.
- Avoid repeating common trivia questions; aim for interesting facts, unique angles, or surprising details.
- Vary question types: it can be a fact, a “which of these is true?”, or an identification question.
- Ensure all four choices are diverse and plausible, not obviously wrong or joke answers (unless the topic allows humor).
- The correct answer must be accurate and verifiable.
- Keep the question concise—no more than 2-3 sentences.
- Do NOT include any explanation, hints, or commentary in your response—only return the JSON.

Return your response strictly as a JSON object matching this schema:

{
  "question": "string (the trivia question)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "string",
    "B": "string",
    "C": "string",
    "D": "string"
  },
  "answer": "A" | "B" | "C" | "D"
}
