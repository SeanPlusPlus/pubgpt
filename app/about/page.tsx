            PubGPT is an AI-powered pub quiz game that generates new trivia questions on demand.
            It‚Äôs played as a <strong>10-question game</strong> ‚Äî a completely arbitrary number I
            picked, just for fun!

              Hey there! I‚Äôm Sean üëã ‚Äî a software engineer who‚Äôs always loved building little games
              and experiments to explore cool tech. Whether it‚Äôs quirky side projects or tools to
              learn something new, I‚Äôm all about having fun while coding. üé≤‚ú®
            </p>
            <p>
              That‚Äôs what inspired me to create <strong>PubGPT</strong>: an AI-driven pub quiz
              experience that whips up fresh trivia questions on the fly.
            </p>
            <p>
              I use the <strong>OpenAI API</strong> (specifically the GPT-4 model) to dynamically
              generate unique pub-style quiz questions based on a carefully crafted prompt. Each
              question includes four plausible multiple-choice answers, written in the fun,
              competitive tone you‚Äôd expect at a traditional trivia night. üß†
            </p>
            <p>
              By leveraging GPT-4, PubGPT ensures each quiz session is fresh, unpredictable, and
              just a little bit cheeky.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the hood, the trivia engine randomly selects from a huge pool of themed
              categories spanning movies, TV, sports, science, culture, and tons more. Here‚Äôs a peek
              at how the categories and prompts look behind the scenes:

// PROMPT USED TO GENERATE A QUESTION

export const generateTriviaJSONPrompt = (topic) => \`
You are an expert pub quiz master. Your task is to generate one fun and challenging multiple-choice trivia question about the topic: "\${topic}".

Requirements:

- Make the question engaging and well-phrased‚Äînot too dry.
- Avoid repeating common trivia questions; aim for unique angles or surprising facts.
- Vary question styles: facts, identification, or ‚Äúwhich of these is true?‚Äù
- Ensure all four choices are diverse and plausible.
- The correct answer must be accurate and verifiable.
- Keep the question concise (max 2-3 sentences).
- Return ONLY the JSON object. No extra commentary.

Schema:

{
  "question": "string (the trivia question)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "string",
    "B": "string",
    "C": "string",
    "D": "string"
  },
  "answer": "A" | "B" | "C" | "D"
}
\`;
`}
            </pre>
            <p>
              After receiving GPT-4‚Äôs answer, PubGPT strips any extra formatting, safely parses the
              JSON, and serves up your next question. The result? A seamless, ever-changing quiz
              experience that feels like you‚Äôre right at the pub. üçª
